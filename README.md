- 👋 Hi, I’m @jcmatthews511
- 👀 I’m interested in H5p to teach nurses about safe medication administration in a distance learning format, possibly linked to a learning management system (LMS) like Healthstream
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about using simulation and H5p to teach safe medication administration
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on H5p with the Canadian Alliance of Nurse Educators using Simulation (CAN-Sim) or the US group ANPD, or INASCL
